# Hotels-50k: A new approach

This study was done as a part of the AI course offered by Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, under Dr. Rishabh Kaushal.
Our team consists of the following members:
1. Srishti Vashistha

## Aim
The aim of the study is to recognize a hotel from an image of a hotel room in
order to aid in human trafficking investigations. The images give us information
regarding the places where victims have been trafficked and where they might be
moved by their traffickers in the future.
Recognizing the hotel from images is challenging because of:
* Low image quality
* Uncommon camera perspectives
* Large occlusions (often the victim)
* The similarity of objects (e.g., furniture, art, bedding) across different hotel
rooms

The dataset includes 1 million annotated hotel room images from 50,000 hotels.
The set of images includes professionally captured photographs from travel
websites and crowd-sources images from mobile applications, which bear a great
similarity to the images analyzed in real-world investigations.

## Dataset Statistics
Hotels-50K consists of 1,027,871 images from 50,000 unique hotels around the
world. Each of the images in the Hotels-50K dataset includes the following
metadata: (1) hotel name, (2) geographic location, and (3) hotel chain, or Other if
the hotel property is not part of a major chain.
Of the 50,000 hotel classes in the Hotels-50K training dataset,
13,900 have TraffickCam user submitted images (a total of 55,061 TraffickCam
images are included in the training set). There are no hotels in the dataset that
have only TraffickCam images.
